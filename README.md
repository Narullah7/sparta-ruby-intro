# Sparta ruby intro

This is a lab assaignment I did at sparta global covering ruby variables e.g. hashes, variables, arrays, intergers, floats. I also learnt how to access these values and present them in a appropiate way.

Finally I created a class in ruby with methods and run RSpec tests on them, which all passed.

## Running the tests

To run the RSpec tests start at the root directory and in the terminal run:

```
cd ruby_variables_starter_code
```
followed by
```
rspec
```
